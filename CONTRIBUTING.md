# Contribution Guidelines

It's almost inevitable that any “awesome” repository will slowly bloat over time and lose its focus.

To guard against that — and to protect my own time — please understand that while **contributions are encouraged**, this repository is ultimately a reflection of **my own personal, biased opinions as a solo game developer**.

If you strongly disagree with the choices I’ve made, you are more than welcome to **fork this repository and maintain your own list** of awesome solo game dev tools.

That said, I genuinely enjoy reviewing contributions and I’m happy to consider all of them.

## ✅ Contribution Process

If you’d like to contribute, please follow these rules:

1. **One pull request per suggestion**  
   - Do not bundle multiple tools in a single PR.

2. **Include a short reason**  
   - Explain *why* the tool is awesome and *why it helps solo developers*.

3. **Ordering matters**  
   - Unless a section is explicitly alphabetical, please **add new items at the end** of the list.  
   - First-come-first-serve keeps things fair.

4. **Categories are flexible**  
   - If you think a tool belongs in a different category — or a **new category is needed** — feel free to suggest edits in your PR.

5. **Maturity matters**  
   - I generally only accept tools that:
     - Are **at least one year old**
     - Show **consistent updates or active maintenance**
     - Are actually usable by a **solo developer**, not just teams

6. **Tools only**
   - This list is intentionally limited to:
     - Game engines
     - Art & animation tools
     - Audio & music tools
     - Testing & debugging tools
   - Tutorials, blogs, courses, and communities do **not** belong here.

## 🧠 Final Notes

Quality > quantity.

The goal is not to list *everything*, but to highlight tools that genuinely help one person **design, build, test, and ship a game**.

Thanks for respecting the curation ✌️
